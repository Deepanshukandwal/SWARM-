🛩️ Autonomous Drone Swarm Defense System
🧠 AI-Powered Multi-Agent System for Intelligent Aerial Defense

The Autonomous Drone Swarm Defense System is an AI-driven simulation and control framework that enables multiple drones to coordinate, detect, and respond to threats in a defense environment. Inspired by swarm intelligence, this system allows drones to make independent yet cooperative decisions, ensuring adaptive, decentralized, and efficient defense strategies without full human intervention.

🚀 Features

🤖 Swarm Intelligence: Drones operate using local rules and reinforcement learning to achieve coordinated group behavior.

🛰️ Autonomous Threat Detection: Identifies and tracks enemy targets using computer vision and sensor simulation.

⚙️ Decentralized Control: No central command — drones share information and react collaboratively.

🧩 Behavioral Simulation: Models complex behaviors such as pursuit, evasion, and resource defense.

📊 Visualization Interface: Real-time 3D simulation or dashboard to visualize drone movements and interactions.

🧠 Technical Architecture

Input Layer:

Environment simulation with multiple agents (drones and intruders).

Sensor data or simulated inputs (camera, radar, GPS).

AI & Decision Layer:

Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Rule-Based System for decision-making.

Each drone acts as an independent agent following behavior policies (attack, defend, patrol).

Communication Layer:

Inter-drone communication using message passing or shared states.

Enables coordination and collective strategy formulation.

Output Layer:

Drone movements and actions visualized on a simulation dashboard.

Performance metrics like threat neutralization, time, and energy efficiency.
